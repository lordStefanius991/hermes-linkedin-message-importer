<h1>Privacy Policy – Hermes LinkedIn Message Importer</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> Nov 25, 2025</p>

<p>
Hermes – LinkedIn Message Importer (“Hermes”) is a browser extension designed to help users organize
their existing LinkedIn conversations locally. This privacy policy explains how the extension handles user data.
Hermes is an independent project and is not affiliated, endorsed, or sponsored by LinkedIn Corporation.
</p>

<h2>1. Data We Access</h2>
<p>
Hermes only reads data that is already visible to you on your LinkedIn interface. Depending on how you use the extension,
it may read:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Names of participants in your conversation lists</li>
<li>Message content, including snippets</li>
<li>Timestamps associated with messages</li>
<li>Conversation metadata (e.g., unread status)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hermes does NOT collect sensitive personal data</strong> such as passwords, account information, payment details, location, or device identifiers.</p>

<h2>2. How Data Is Stored</h2>
<ul>
<li>All data processed by Hermes is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>, for example using your browser’s local storage.</li>
<li>Hermes does <strong>not transmit or upload any data to external servers</strong> owned by the developer or third parties.</li>
<li>Data remains available only on your device unless you manually export it yourself.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
<ul>
