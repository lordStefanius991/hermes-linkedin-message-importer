\# Privacy Policy – Hermes – LinkedIn Message Importer



\_Last updated: \[replace with date, e.g. 2025-11-24]\_



Hermes – LinkedIn Message Importer (“Hermes”, “the extension”) is a browser extension designed to help users view, organize, and work with their LinkedIn conversations more efficiently. This privacy policy explains how the extension handles data.



Hermes is an independent project and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by LinkedIn Corporation.



---



\## 1. Data processed by the extension



Hermes processes only the data that is already visible to you in your LinkedIn interface. Depending on how you use the extension, it may process:



\- Text content of your LinkedIn conversations (messages, snippets, participants)

\- Basic metadata related to those conversations (such as conversation title, participant name, timestamps, message URL)

\- Local configuration and preferences (for example: language, UI settings, filters or tags that you define inside the extension)



Hermes \*\*does not\*\* ask you to create an account and \*\*does not\*\* collect data such as passwords or payment information.



---



\## 2. How and where the data is stored



All data processed by Hermes is stored \*\*locally on your device\*\* (for example using the browser’s local storage or extension storage).



\- The developer of Hermes \*\*does not receive\*\* a copy of your messages or metadata.

\- Data is \*\*not transmitted\*\* to external servers controlled by the developer.

\- Data is only available inside your own browser, on your own machine, unless you choose to export or copy it manually.



---



\## 3. Data sharing



Hermes does \*\*not\*\* sell, rent, or share your data with third parties.



The only way data can leave your device is if \*\*you\*\* manually copy or export it (for example, copying a suggested reply to the clipboard, or exporting a list of conversations).



---



\## 4. Permissions used by the extension



Hermes requires some browser permissions in order to function. These permissions are used only for the purposes described below:



\- \*\*Host permissions (e.g. https://www.linkedin.com/\*\*\\\*)  

&nbsp; Used to read and structure the content of the LinkedIn messaging pages that you are already viewing, so that the extension can display and organize your conversations locally. Hermes does not modify the LinkedIn website and does not perform automated actions on your behalf.



\- \*\*scripting / content scripts\*\*  

&nbsp; Used to inject code into the LinkedIn messaging page so the extension can read elements on the page and format them for display inside the extension’s UI.



\- \*\*tabs / activeTab\*\*  

&nbsp; Used to detect the currently active LinkedIn tab when you trigger an action (for example, importing the current conversation or sidebar) and to open the related conversation URL when needed.



\- \*\*clipboardWrite\*\*  

&nbsp; Used only to copy text that is already visible to you (for example, a suggested reply that you decide to copy). The extension does not read the clipboard content; it only writes to it when you explicitly request it.



\- \*\*storage\*\*  

&nbsp; Used to save local settings and preferences (such as language, filters, tags, or UI configuration). This information is stored only on your device.



Hermes does not use remote code execution and does not load executable code from remote servers.



---



\## 5. Data retention and user control



Because Hermes stores data locally:



\- You can clear extension data at any time by clearing the extension’s storage or using your browser’s tools to clear site/extension data.

\- You can stop all data processing by \*\*disabling or uninstalling\*\* the extension from your browser.



Once the extension is removed, it can no longer process any data from your LinkedIn pages.



---



\## 6. Children’s privacy



Hermes is intended for professional use (e.g., recruiters, job seekers, and other adult LinkedIn users) and is \*\*not\*\* directed at children under the age of 16.



---



\## 7. Changes to this policy



This privacy policy may be updated from time to time. When it is updated, the “Last updated” date at the top of this page will be changed.



If, in the future, Hermes starts to send data to external servers or to process data in a different way, this privacy policy will be updated accordingly, and additional consent may be required where applicable.
